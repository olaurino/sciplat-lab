# We need three pieces of information to build the container:
#  tag is the tag on the input DM Stack container.  It is mandatory.
#  image is the Docker repository image we're pushing to; we can use the
#   default if we don't specify it, which goes to Docker Hub.  image
#   may be a comma-separated list of target repositories.
#  supplementary is an additional tag, which forces the build to an "exp_"
#   (that is, experimental) tag and adds "_" plus the supplement at the end.

# Therefore: the typical use of the Makefile would look like:
#   make tag=w_2021_50

# To push to a different repository:
#   make tag=w_2021_50 image=ghcr.io/lsst-sqre/sciplat-lab

# To use a different input image:
#   make tag=w_2021_49_c0023.008 \
#    input=ts-dockerhub.lsst.org/lsstts/sal-sciplat: \
#    image=ts-dockerhub.lsst.org/lsstts/sal-sciplat-lab

# To tag as experimental "foo" (-> exp_w_2021_50_foo):
#   make tag=w_2021_50 supplementary=foo

# There are five targets: clean, dockerfile, image, push, and retag.

# The default is "push", and the first four are always done in strict linear
#  order.
# "clean" just removes the generated Dockerfile.
# "dockerfile"
#  generates the Dockerfile from the template, but does not build an image
#  or push it.
# "image" builds the image with Docker but does not push it to a repository.
# "push" (aka "all") also pushes the built image.  It assumes that the
#  building user already has appropriate push credentials set.

# The fifth target, "retag", is a little different.  Its tag is the tag on
#  the input image, but "input" will, itself, be a sciplat-lab container.
#  "supplementary" will be the tag to add to this image; no substitution will
#  be done on either the input tag or the supplementary tag.  As with "push"
#  it assumes that the building user has appropriate push credentials set.
